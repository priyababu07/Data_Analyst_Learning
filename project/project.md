# 🧠 Superstore Sales Analysis – SQL Data Analysis Project

Welcome to my **first project** in my journey to become a Data Analyst!  
This project kicks off a **series of hands-on projects** designed to help me learn data analysis through real-world datasets, with a focus on SQL.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

Analyze sales data from a retail "Superstore" dataset using **SQL** to extract business insights.  
Key goals:
- Learn how to clean and explore data
- Practice SQL queries (joins, aggregations, filters, ranking)
- Understand patterns in customer behavior, sales, and profitability

---

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle – Superstore Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final)
- Contains information on:
  - Customers
  - Orders
  - Products
  - Sales
  - Regions & Shipping

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Excel**: For initial cleaning (removing duplicates)
- **PostgreSQL**: To store and query the data
- **pgAdmin**: For managing the database
- (Optional: Power BI / Tableau for future visualization)

---

## 🔍 SQL Tasks Performed

### 🔹 Basic Queries
- List customers from the "West" region
- Get orders shipped via "First Class"

### 🔹 Joins & Aggregation
- Total sales and profit by region
- Top 5 customers by total sales
- Monthly sales trends

### 🔹 Advanced Queries
- Most profitable product category
- City with most orders
- Top 10 best-selling products ranked using `RANK()`

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- Certain regions consistently outperform others in terms of profit
- A few customer segments contribute significantly to total sales
- Shipping method impacts sales behavior in some areas

*(More insights will be added as I progress!)*

## 🎯 What I Learned

- How to clean and load real-world data into PostgreSQL
- Writing meaningful SQL queries using `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, and window functions
- Importance of understanding data relationships before querying

---

## 🚀 What's Next?

This is **Project 1** of my SQL & Data Analysis Learning Series.

Next projects will explore:
- Advanced SQL (CTEs, subqueries, case statements)
- Data visualization
- Connecting SQL to Python (Pandas, Jupyter)
- Real business case studies

---

## 🙌 Acknowledgments

- Kaggle for the dataset
- OpenAI & ChatGPT for guidance and query explanations
